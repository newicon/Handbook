# Job Titles

Within each of our job functions, we’ve mapped our trajectory of mastery to five different levels. That title structure is shared amongst all departments, but the particulars of what characterises one level from another will of course be different. 
Here’s an example of the titles for programming:  

- Junior Programmer
- Programmer
- Senior Programmer
- Lead Programmer
- Principal Programmer

We also try to align our payment strcutures as much as possible to these roles as opposed to personal negotiations.
